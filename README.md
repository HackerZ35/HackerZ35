🚀 Hi there, I'm HackerZ35 aka Shugan!
⚡ Vibe Coder | Automation Enthusiast | Linux Lover

I build things that look good on the outside and work automatically on the inside. Whether I'm tweaking CSS transitions or wiring up complex n8n workflows, I'm usually doing it from a Linux terminal with a lo-fi playlist running.

🤖 What I'm Currently Up To

    Automation: Building workflows that connect APIs so I don't have to do repetitive tasks. If it can be automated in n8n, I’m doing it.

    Frontend: Perfecting the art of "centered divs" and responsive layouts using Tailwind.

    Vibe Coding: Experimenting with AI-assisted coding to build prototypes at lightning speed.

📺 When I'm Not Coding

    ⚽ Sports: Big fan of [Insert Team Name] and catching weekend matches.

    🎬 Entertainment: Hooked on Sci-Fi movies and binge-watching TV shows (Dark, Mr. Robot, etc.).

    🐧 Linux: Breaking my distro and fixing it just for the fun of it.

    🎧 Vibe: I believe coding is 40% logic and 60% finding the right playlist.
